# Games using Python

Welcome to the Python Games repository! This repository contains Python files for various simple games implemented using the Pygame library.

## Games Included

1. **Flappy Bird**: A clone of the classic Flappy Bird game where the player controls a bird to navigate through obstacles.
   
2. **Snake**: The classic Snake game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own tail.
   
3. **Tic Tac Toe**: The timeless Tic Tac Toe game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## How to Run

To run any of these games, you'll need to have Python installed on your system along with the Pygame library. You can install Pygame using pip:

```
pip install pygame
```

Once you have Python and Pygame installed, you can run each game's Python file directly. For example, to run Flappy Bird, execute the `flappy_bird.py` file:

```
python flappy_bird.py
```

## Controls

Each game has its own set of controls, which are usually mentioned in the game's interface or in the code comments. For example:

- Flappy Bird: Click or press any key to make the bird flap.
- Snake: Use the arrow keys to change the snake's direction.
- Tic Tac Toe: Click on the grid to place your marker (X or O).
